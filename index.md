title: "Welcome to Cloud Computing"
---

Welcome to Cloud Computing! This course provides an introduction to cloud computing with specific consideration for &ldquo;web-scale&rdquo; application development. More details are available on <a href="http://home.uchicago.edu/vas/#cloud" target="_blank" rel="noopener">my UChicago home page</a>.

### Logistics

We use a flipped classroom structure: each week you watch pre-recorded video lectures on that week's topic(s); during class hours we engage in discussion, demonstrations, hands-on exercises, and some live lectures. We typically spend anywhere from 90 minutes to a couple of hours in class during most weeks. We will not run the full three hours in person as you would expect for a typical MPCS class, but you're expected to spend about the same amount of time, in total, between watching videos and in-person discussion.

### Class Resources

- The [Canvas site](https://canvas.uchicago.edu/courses/49124) for the Spring 2023 class contains [video lectures](https://canvas.uchicago.edu/courses/49124/external_tools/1471) and submission links for [homework assignments](https://canvas.uchicago.edu/courses/49124/assignments).
- <a href="https://pollev.com/vasiliadis" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Question "parking lot"</a>: As you watch the videos capture your questions here for discussion during class. You can also upvote questions added by other students. It's all anonymous so please don't hold back!
- <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1pjw3gWKkbpVKr1V6GZDvY3WZwg55OYIX?usp=share_link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Our shared Google Drive</a> contains lecture slides, assignment specifications, optional readings, and class exercises (you <i>must</i> be authenticated with your CNetID@uchicago.edu account to access these files).
- We use <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/14ZYcarb8GX5pWQVM3cXUfv2GjTUvJkBXbC_RvJ7L55M/edit" target="_blank" rel="noopener">specifications grading</a> in this class. Please read this document carefully and ask me to elaborate on anything that's unclear.
- We use [specifications grading](/course/specifications-grading) as a means to  (hopefully) reduce stress and allow you to focus on learning.

### Tools

- We [work with Python](/course/working-with-python) exclusively.
