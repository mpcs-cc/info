# Specifications Grading in MPCS 51083

We use specifications grading in this course in an effort to reduce the level of stress that you, the student, feel, and to (hopefully) motivate you to engage at whatever level you decide. Whether a “C+” is fine or you feel you must get an “A”, either is perfectly acceptable from our perspective, and we describe precisely what is required to get that grade—no more, no less. Here’s how it works:

- You submit assignments and accrue tokens for each assignment.
- You select which assignments to submit. A certain minimum set is required; how many additional assignments you complete beyond that minimum is up to you.
- Completed assignments are graded on a Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory basis.
- Satisfactory work accrues all tokens for the assignment; unsatisfactory work, none.
- Your grade is determined by the total number of tokens you accrue, the number of satisfactory assignments completed at the “O” level and performance on quizzes.

The requirements for specific letter grades are defined below. This is good (we think!) because there is no “curving” of grades/dependency on your peers’ performance.
